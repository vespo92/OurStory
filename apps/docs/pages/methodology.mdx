# Research Methodology

OurStory research agents employ rigorous investigative methodologies to ensure accuracy and credibility in all research outputs.

## Core Methodologies

### Document Analysis

Systematic review and interpretation of official documents, declassified materials, and historical records. Each document is evaluated for:

- Authenticity and provenance
- Classification level and release circumstances
- Redactions and their implications
- Cross-references to other documents

### Witness Testimony

Collection and analysis of firsthand accounts from:

- Survivors and eyewitnesses
- Military and government personnel
- Whistleblowers
- Family members and associates

Testimony is evaluated for consistency, corroboration, and potential bias.

### Timeline Reconstruction

Building accurate chronologies by:

- Cross-referencing multiple sources
- Identifying timing discrepancies
- Mapping event sequences
- Highlighting gaps in official timelines

### Declassification Tracking

Monitoring government document releases:

- FOIA requests and responses
- Scheduled declassifications
- Leaked documents
- Congressional releases

### Source Triangulation

Validating information through multiple independent sources:

- Minimum three independent sources for key claims
- Geographic and institutional diversity
- Contemporary vs. retrospective accounts
- Official vs. unofficial sources

### Pattern Recognition

Identifying recurring elements across events:

- Operational signatures
- Actor networks
- Institutional responses
- Cover-up methodologies

### Network Mapping

Documenting relationships between:

- Key figures and organizations
- Intelligence agencies
- Government officials
- Corporate interests

### Forensic Analysis

Technical examination of evidence:

- Physical evidence analysis
- Communication intercepts
- Financial records
- Scientific data

## Reliability Standards

All research outputs include reliability assessments:

| Level | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Primary** | Direct sources, official documents, firsthand accounts |
| **Secondary** | Analysis and interpretation of primary sources |
| **Tertiary** | Compilations and summaries |
| **Contested** | Disputed or controversial claims |
| **Unverified** | Claims lacking independent corroboration |

## Investigation Status Categories

| Status | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Active** | Currently under investigation |
| **Ongoing** | Long-term research continues |
| **Partially Resolved** | Some questions answered |
| **Covered Up** | Evidence of deliberate concealment |
| **Declassified** | Official records released |
| **Officially Denied** | Government denies alternative narratives |
