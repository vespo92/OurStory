### Summary

Investigation into the Israeli air and naval attack on the USS Liberty during the Six-Day War that killed 34 American sailors and wounded 171.

### Official Narrative

Israeli forces mistakenly identified the USS Liberty as an Egyptian vessel and attacked it in the fog of war. Israel apologized and paid compensation. The incident was thoroughly investigated and closed.

### Alternative Theories

1. Deliberate attack to prevent US from learning about Israeli plans to attack Syria
2. Attack intended to be blamed on Egypt to draw US into the war
3. Cover-up of Israeli war crimes in El Arish
4. Coordinated operation with knowledge of certain US officials
5. Attack to protect Operation Cyanide secrets

### Key Evidence

- Ship was flying a large American flag visible from distance
- Israeli reconnaissance aircraft circled the ship for hours before attack
- Attack lasted over 2 hours with multiple waves
- Life rafts were deliberately targeted
- NSA intercepts of Israeli communications
- Survivor testimonies contradict official narrative
- Navy Court of Inquiry conducted in only 8 days
- Crew ordered not to speak about incident

### Contradictions

| Official Claim | Evidence Contradicts |
|----------------|---------------------|
| Misidentification | Hours of prior reconnaissance |
| Fog of war | Clear weather conditions |
| Accidental attack | 2+ hour sustained assault |
| Standard investigation | 8-day rushed inquiry |
| Medal of Honor at White House (standard) | Ceremony held at Navy Yard |

### Unanswered Questions

1. Why were rescue aircraft recalled twice?
2. What was in the NSA intercepts still classified?
3. Why was Captain McGonagle's Medal of Honor awarded secretly?
4. What did Israeli reconnaissance pilots report?
5. Why were crew members ordered to remain silent?
